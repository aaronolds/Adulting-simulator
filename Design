You can turn this into a simple “Adulting Simulator” with sliders, choices, and a monthly budget outcome. Here’s a solid, realistic structure that also stays kid friendly and adjustable.

Game flow
	1.	Pick a job
	•	Annual salary or hourly wage, hours per week, pay frequency.
	•	Optional: education/skill requirement as “unlock” items.
	2.	Paycheck happens
	•	Gross pay calculated.
	•	Taxes withheld (federal, state, FICA), plus optional local tax.
	•	Benefits decisions deducted (health insurance, 401k).
	3.	Choose your lifestyle
	•	Housing (rent levels), roommates or solo.
	•	Transportation (bus pass, used car, new car).
	•	Phone/internet, groceries, eating out, streaming.
	4.	Monthly bills hit
	•	Fixed bills (rent, insurance, internet).
	•	Variable bills (groceries, utilities).
	•	“Surprises” (car repair, medical bill, birthday gift, school fee).
	5.	Results
	•	End of month cash flow.
	•	Savings progress, debt, credit score meter.
	•	“Stress meter” if they choose too many obligations.

Core adjustable inputs (make everything tweakable)

Income
	•	Salary or hourly + hours
	•	Pay frequency (weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, monthly)
	•	Overtime rules
	•	Bonus or commission (optional)

Taxes (realistic enough, not a tax class)
	•	Filing status (single, married)
	•	State selection or a “state tax rate” slider
	•	FICA slider (on/off if you want, or fixed)
	•	Optional: standard deduction on/off

Benefits
	•	Health plan choices:
	•	None
	•	Employer plan: low premium high deductible
	•	Employer plan: high premium low deductible
	•	401k contribution percent slider (0% to 15%+)
	•	Employer match toggle (for realism)

Expenses
	•	Rent (tiered by “city”)
	•	Utilities (avg plus random variance)
	•	Internet, phone
	•	Subscriptions (Netflix, Disney+, Spotify, gaming, etc)
	•	Food (groceries baseline plus eating out)
	•	Transportation
	•	Debt (student loan, credit card, car loan)
	•	Savings goal (emergency fund)

Random life events (toggleable)
	•	Probability per month, severity levels.
	•	Examples: sick visit, broken phone, car repair, friend wedding, pet expense.

Make it “realistic” without being overwhelming
	•	Use monthly budgeting as the main view (kids understand it).
	•	Show paycheck detail in a collapsible section.
	•	Use simple tax model by default (percentages), with an “advanced mode” that uses brackets.
	•	Add a “compare choices” view: same income, different lifestyle.

Website concept (simple and fun)

Pages
	•	Start: choose age, city, job.
	•	Paycheck: show deductions and take home.
	•	Lifestyle: pick housing, transport, subscriptions.
	•	Month summary: bills, leftover, savings, debt changes.
	•	What if: sliders to change rent, pay, tax rate, inflation.

UI components that work well
	•	Sliders for rent, groceries, utilities, 401k percent.
	•	Toggle buttons for subscriptions.
	•	A “Run next month” button that applies random events.
	•	Charts: cash over time, savings, debt.

Suggested math (minimum viable realism)
	•	Gross monthly = salary / 12 (or hourly * hours * 52 / 12)
	•	FICA: fixed percentage
	•	Federal tax: either simple percent by income band, or brackets in advanced mode
	•	Net pay = gross - taxes - benefits - 401k
	•	End of month = net pay - expenses - surprise costs

Tech stack options

Fastest to build (recommended)
	•	Single page web app: React + Next.js
	•	Store scenarios in JSON so you can tweak numbers easily.
	•	Optional: save profiles in browser local storage.

Even simpler
	•	A spreadsheet first (Excel or Google Sheets), then port to web once the model feels right.

If you want, I can generate a working starter

I can give you:
	•	A JSON “price book” (rent tiers, subscription prices, job salaries).
	•	A basic budget engine (JavaScript).
	•	A simple Next.js UI with sliders and a monthly summary.

To tailor it, tell me:
	1.	Age range of your kids
	2.	Your state (or “generic US”)
	3.	Do you want taxes to be “simple percent” or “real brackets”?
